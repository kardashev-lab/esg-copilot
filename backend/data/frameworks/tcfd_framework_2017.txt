TCFD Framework 2017 - Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures

OVERVIEW
The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was established by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to develop voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies in providing information to lenders, insurers, investors, and other stakeholders.

CORE ELEMENTS

1. GOVERNANCE
Disclose the organization's governance around climate-related risks and opportunities.

Recommendation 1: Governance
a) Describe the board's oversight of climate-related risks and opportunities
b) Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities

Implementation Guidance:
- Board oversight: Describe how the board monitors and oversees climate-related risks and opportunities
- Management role: Describe management's role in assessing and managing climate-related risks and opportunities
- Integration: Explain how climate-related risks are integrated into overall risk management

2. STRATEGY
Disclose the actual and potential impacts of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning.

Recommendation 2: Strategy
a) Describe the climate-related risks and opportunities the organization has identified over the short, medium, and long term
b) Describe the impact of climate-related risks and opportunities on the organization's businesses, strategy, and financial planning
c) Describe the resilience of the organization's strategy, taking into consideration different climate-related scenarios, including a 2°C or lower scenario

Implementation Guidance:
- Risk identification: Describe processes for identifying climate-related risks and opportunities
- Time horizons: Define short, medium, and long term (e.g., 0-1 year, 1-5 years, 5+ years)
- Impact assessment: Quantify financial impacts where possible
- Scenario analysis: Use multiple scenarios including 2°C or lower scenario

3. RISK MANAGEMENT
Disclose how the organization identifies, assesses, and manages climate-related risks.

Recommendation 3: Risk Management
a) Describe the organization's processes for identifying and assessing climate-related risks
b) Describe the organization's processes for managing climate-related risks
c) Describe how processes for identifying, assessing, and managing climate-related risks are integrated into the organization's overall risk management

Implementation Guidance:
- Risk identification: Describe processes for identifying climate-related risks
- Risk assessment: Explain how risks are assessed and prioritized
- Risk management: Describe risk management processes and controls
- Integration: Explain integration with overall risk management framework

4. METRICS AND TARGETS
Disclose the metrics and targets used to assess and manage relevant climate-related risks and opportunities.

Recommendation 4: Metrics and Targets
a) Disclose the metrics used by the organization to assess climate-related risks and opportunities in line with its strategy and risk management process
b) Disclose Scope 1, Scope 2, and, if appropriate, Scope 3 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the related risks
c) Describe the targets used by the organization to manage climate-related risks and opportunities and performance against targets

Implementation Guidance:
- Metrics: Disclose relevant metrics for assessing climate-related risks and opportunities
- GHG emissions: Report Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 emissions where material
- Targets: Set and disclose targets for managing climate-related risks and opportunities
- Performance: Report performance against targets

CLIMATE-RELATED RISKS

Market: Changing customer behavior, uncertain market signals, and increased costs of doing business
- Changing customer behavior
- Uncertain market signals
- Increased cost of raw materials

Reputational: Changing customer or community perceptions of an organization's contribution to or detraction from the transition to a lower-carbon economy
- Changing customer preferences
- Stigmatization of sector
- Increased stakeholder concern or negative stakeholder feedback

SCENARIO ANALYSIS

Recommended Scenarios:
1. 2°C or Lower Scenario: Aligned with Paris Agreement goals
2. Business-as-Usual Scenario: Based on current trends and policies
3. Disorderly Transition Scenario: Rapid policy changes and market disruptions

Scenario Analysis Process:
1. Define scenarios and time horizons
2. Identify climate-related risks and opportunities
3. Assess financial impacts
4. Evaluate strategic resilience
5. Develop response strategies
